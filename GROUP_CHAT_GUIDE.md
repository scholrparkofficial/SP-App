## Security Rules

Updated Firestore rules to support groups:

```javascript
// Groups collection
match /groups/{groupId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
  allow create: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in request.resource.data.participants;
}

// Group messages
match /groups/{groupId}/messages/{messageId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && 
    request.auth.uid in get(/databases/$(database)/documents/groups/$(groupId)).data.participants;
}
```
